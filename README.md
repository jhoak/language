# language
A vulgar programming language. Some small examples:

```
max(x, y)
    x aint a number, or y aint a number?
        fuck that shit
    well... x > y?
        return that shit
    well...
        return that other shit
        
trymax()
    try
        m = max(5, "henry")
        yo "Found max(5, \"henry\") and it's %d" % m
        return m
    oh fuck
        yo dumbass "Couldn't figure out max(5, \"henry\"). Gee, I wonder who fucked that up?"
        return fuckall
        
max(shitload)
    empty shitload?
        return fuckall
    highest = first in shitload
    for each thing in shitload - highest:
        thing > highest?
            highest = thing
    return highest
    
ass Person
    make(firstname, lastname, age)

```
